ALGORITHM:

Step 1: Take a string from the user and store it in a variable.
Step 2: Initialise the two count variables to 0.
Step 3: Use a for loop to traverse through the characters in the string and increment the first count variable each time a lowercase character is encountered and increment the second count variable each time a uppercase character is encountered.
Step 4: Print the total count of both the variables.
Step 5: Exit.
